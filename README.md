# The Letter

```ruby
require "./love"

a_letter to: Augusta do
  twas(only: 16.months.ago) { The::Universe << You.to(OurFamily) }
  life.has :been => %w(i n c r e d i b l y).zip(*"wonderful!").ever_since
  We::Wish.we_could { experience these_moments: over & over }
  You.will always_be: Loved, and: Cherished
  until Infinity.ends do; Forever.(); end
end
```

# Why

I wanted to creatively express my affection for my daughter, Augusta, in a way I know best. I chose Ruby for its flexibility and elegance. My hope is to introduce her to its boundless beauty someday soon using this composition.

This is a real, working, program which outputs `Augusta, we <3 you!` when executed. Be sure to read the [love.rb](https://github.com/jpfuentes2/a-letter-to-Augusta/blob/master/love.rb) file which supports the letter’s syntax. I tried to keep it symmetrical and legible so that the source closely resembles the content.
