# The Poem

```ruby
require "./love"

a_letter to: Augusta do
  twas(only: 16.months.ago) { TheUniverse << You.to(OurFamily) }
  life.has :been => %w(i n c r e d i b l y).zip(*"wonderul!").ever_since
  We::Wish.we_could { experience these_moments: over & over }
  You.will always_be: Loved, and: Cherished
  until Infinity.ends do; Forever.(); end
end
```

# Why

I wanted to creatively express my affection for my daughter, Augusta, in a way I know best. I chose Ruby for its flexibility and elegance. My hope is to introduce her to its boundless beauty someday using this composition.
